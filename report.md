# Team BEJJ Project 3: Usability Report

## Usability Test 1
For this usability test, the user was an architecture student who uses the website to assist himself in building design (Instagram, Pinterest for inspiration). The user noted that he saw the website's color palette as very aesthetically pleasing. Most pages the user said that he was able to clearly see the important sections. In the store page, the user did not see the "Top of Page" button at the bottom right.

## Usability Test 2
This user was a product manager on top of being a full time student, providing a unique perspective. Like test 1, this user enjoyed the color scheme of the store and quickly recognized it as a plant store. This user used the "Top of Page" button on the bottom right of the store page, but noted that they would like the store page more if there was a search menu at the top.

The user noted that the payment page does not look professional and secure, but it was clear. Additionally, he showed desire to make the process more clear and to make it easier to know what pages come next. Lastly, they requested for buttons to be made more clear.
